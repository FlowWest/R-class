The corresponding R Markdown chapter in the R for Data Sience is [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html)

R Markdown provides an unified authoring framework for data science, combining your code, its results,
and your prose commentary. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output
formats, like PDFs, Word files, slideshows, and more.

# The Basics 

1. The very top of the file has a chunk of code surrounded by `---`s, we call this
the YAML and it lets you apply changes such styling to the document as a whole. Most
of the time we are only interested in Title, Author, and Date.

2. R code is embedded in the document in chunks sorrounded by ``` and {r} on the top
set of these.

```{r}
# this is an example of R code within a document 
x <- 1:100
mean(x)
```

3. All other text, is formatted by a markup language called Markdown. 

4. We compile a RMarkdown document with knitr, in Rstudio click the 'knit' button 
or use the shortcut `Ctrl-Shift-K`


# Markdown Basics

Text formatting. 

We can format text with the following 

```
*italic* or _italic_ 

**bold** or __bold__

`inline code` 

supercript^2^

$2 + 2 = 4$
```

*italic* or _italic_

**bold**  or __bold__

a superscript^2^

and inline code `x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)`

and math $2 + 2 = 4$ (this is not Markdown its Latex and only works if you have a Latex engine)

---------

Headings.

We can add different levels of headings using `#`'s

```
# 1st Level

## 2nd Level

### 3rd Level

and so on
```

# First Level
## Second Level 
### Third Level

----------

Lists.

Bulleted lists are created with `*`'s

```
* list item 1
* list item 2
* list item 3
```

* list item 1
* list item 2
* list item 3


Numbered Lists

```
1. list item 1
2. list item 2
3. list item 3
```

1. list item 1
2. list item 2
3. list item 3


--------------

Links and images 

```
A regular link
<http://google.com> 

A link annoted with custom text
[click here for google](http://google.com)

A link with optional text (this time rendering a image)
![show only when image does not show](https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.png)
```

Tables 

```
First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
```

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

Use Kable. If you table is a dataframe in R, use `knitr::kable()` to render 
a nice table

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars))
```


# R Chunks

We can customize the R chunks within a document by adding options within the 
`{r}` of an R chunk. Here are some popular choices

* eval = FALSE prevents code from being evaluated. 

* include = FALSE runs the code, but doesnâ€™t show the code or results in the final document. 

* echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. 

* message = FALSE or warning = FALSE prevents messages or warnings from appearing in the finished file.

* results = 'hide' hides printed output; fig.show = 'hide' hides plots.

Other R stuff. 

We can also embed R code in the inline version of code `this inline remember?`.
We just have to add a little `r` to the start. Here we show the mean of 
a random sample from rnorm(100) is `r mean(rnorm(100))`
